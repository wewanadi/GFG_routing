## Main Idea
### Greedy Routing
- Just Greedy will suffer deadend, than never get to destination.

### Face Routing
- If we can walk every steps face by face, than greedily choose face. 
- However, we can't walk on face,we can only walk along the edge.

- bad case for Face Routing

### GFG Routing
- Walking on face, sometimes seems taking a long route.
- What if we Greedy walk until deadend, than convert to face routing mode.
- Until there is no deadend existed, convert back to greedy mode.

## Algorithm

### How to walk on a face


### Algorithm
- Get a graph
- Generate some links, to make it a planar subgraph.
- Do face routing alg.
